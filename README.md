# Creating repo locally
Demo git file for practicing push file from vs code to git.
First move to this folder and type git init to create git file locally.
First step just create a file sample file like readme.
Save the file git add and git commit after that push the to git repositary.
But since you created a new file vs code does not know where to push this file
to do that create a empty repositary in github type git remote in termial with ssh link
